# Little Lemon

Hi, friend! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying the Meta Front-End Developer course, and one of the projects for the *HTML and CSS in Depth* module is to submit a webpage demonstrating what Iâ€™ve learned.

## About the Project

After completing the webpage using only HTML and CSS, I still felt that it looked like a page from my childhood. You can still find this version in the `pure` folder. Later, I discovered a design template at [Wix](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/3301) that looked appealing. So, I reimplemented it using Bootstrap with customized Sass files. The fonts might be a bit off, but I think it looks much better! 

This project is a simple website for the Little Lemon restaurant.

## Demo

Provide a screenshot or link to the live site here if available.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass (for custom styling)
- Bootstrap

## Folder Structure

- `pure/`: Original version using only HTML and CSS.
- `bootstrap/`: Enhanced version with Bootstrap and Sass customization.

## Feedback

Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts on the design and layout. What do you think?
